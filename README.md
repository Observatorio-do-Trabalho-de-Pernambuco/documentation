# Documentation
This is a test of how to implement good documentation practices in our repository. Currently, it is in a separate repository because upgrading our GitHub account or making the current repository public would be required. Since this is a proof of concept for documentation centralization, I'm using an isolated repository, but we can adjust this strategy in the future.
